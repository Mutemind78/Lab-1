            <br> <em>Gujarat</em> in <em>India</em>. Later, at the <em>age</em> of <em>6</em>, I was admitted to the school which was about <em>15kms</em> away 
            <br> from my village. My school name was <em>Supath E.M.H.S</em> located near the <em>Gulf of Cambay</em>. I studied their

            <br> in my school. I was very fond of it, so I use to participate in each and every activaties, every year.
        <br>During first <em>8 to 9 years</em> I didn't recieved anything special in my achievements. But, as a grew up and 
    <br> started understanding the things I started participating in more activities and here the <em>game begins...</em>
<br>I was in <em>10th grade</em> and I recieved the <em>Hall of Fame</em> For which I was working since my childhood. 
<br>In that year we had a <em>Science Fair</em>, and I was leading my group, we decided to built a <em>Robotic Remote 
    <br>Control Car</em>. Also, there was a <em>Grand Sports Tournament</em> so, I participated in that too. And lastly the 
<br> day I was waiting for that came it was <em>Annual Award Function Day</em>. Supraisingly, my <em>father</em> was called as the
<br><em>Chief Guest</em> of the event. I was not ready to belive that he is here and my work was done. </p>


        <h3>Achievements...</h3>
<p>On that day I was holding the title of 
   <br><em>1) "Student of the Year"</em>  
  <br><em>2)  "Sports Championship"</em>

<br> I attained and I was really very happy to see my <em>father on stage</em> and making them <em>proud</em> to be my <em>parent</em>. </p>


        <h3>Goals...</h3>
<p>Afterall, before entering to the important years of my schooling i.e 11th and 12th grade, I decided to pursue
    <br> my further studies in <em>Canada</em> after completing my 12th Grade. And, <em>I made it scuccessfully....</em> 
<br> I <em>completed</em> my <em>12th grade</em> with <em>81%</em>, later, I started preparing of <em>IELTS</em> to move 1 step ahead towards my goals. 
<br> and again I <em>cracked</em> it. And finally I am here to complete my further studies..</p>
<p>To summarize <em>"Experiencing a scuccessfull Life"</em>
    <br> That I made it happen, I succed in each and every step of reaching my goals. Although many <em>barriers</em> came 
    <br>but I <em>tackled</em> and this experience defines me that also in future, I am not going to stop <em>untill and unless</em>
    <br>I will achieve all my goals and <em>change</em> the status of <em>"Experiencing a scuccessfull life"</em> to <em>"Experienced a scuccessfull life"</em>.
